# React Clicker Game: A Learning Project 🕹️

## What is a micro-challenge?
- A micro-challenge is a task/challenge that is a small project of code that can be done in a certain amount of time. It can be any idea that comes to mind but has to specifically be innovative and promote learning in any way. It is important that the micro challenges have different difficulty levels because some people might be more experienced than others so there has to be variety in that way. Most challenges should be able to be completed within a couple of hours to 2 days.

## Difficulty = ⭐️

## What you will build:
- You will build a clicker game in React, that counts the number of clicks you make in a certain number of seconds and then displays your score.

## How you will build it:
-  You will find the core structure of the app already set up. However, certain functions and state logic are omitted intentionally. Your task is to explore the codebase and fill in the gaps to make the game functional.

## Duration:
- 1-2 hours

# Instructions
## 🚀 Setup

### Clone this repo to your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x.x or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/React-Clicker-Game-Learning-Project.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

## 🏆 Challenge
1. Timer logic: Ensure the timer counts and stops correctly.
2. Click counter: Track and display the number of clicks within the given time.
3. Clicks per second: Calculate and show the clicking speed.

### 🎨 Styling Your Game
- Feel free to dive into the CSS and adjust styles, animations, and layouts to make this game your own! Consider experimenting with Ant Design components to enhance the UI/UX of the app.

### 🧩 Possible Extensions
1. Implement a high score feature, storing the highest clicks per second.
2. Add various difficulty levels that adjust the timer or target click area size.
3. Implement additional visual feedbacks (e.g., animations, color changes) upon user interactions.
