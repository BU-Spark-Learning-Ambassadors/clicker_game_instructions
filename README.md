# React Clicker Game: A Learning Project 🕹️

## Introduction

Welcome to the **React Clicker Game Learning Project**! This project sets up a framework for a simple clicker game built with React and Ant Design. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves filling in the missing logic and functionalities to make the game run smoothly. Ideal for beginners looking to practice state management, effects, and event handling in React.

## Difficulty = ⭐️

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x.x or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/React-Clicker-Game-Learning-Project.git
# Navigate into the Project Directory

cd template
# Install Dependencies
npm install
# Run the App
npm start

# 🧠 Your Task
- You will find the core structure of the app already set up. However, certain functions and state logic are omitted intentionally. Your task is to explore the codebase and fill in the gaps to make the game functional.

# Key Areas to Implement
- Timer logic: Ensure the timer counts and stops correctly.
- Click counter: Track and display the number of clicks within the given time.
- Clicks per second: Calculate and show the clicking speed.
# 🎨 Styling Your Game
- Feel free to dive into the CSS and adjust styles, animations, and layouts to make this game your own! Consider experimenting with Ant Design components to enhance the UI/UX of the app.

# 🧩 Possible Extensions
Implement a high score feature, storing the highest clicks per second.
Add various difficulty levels that adjust the timer or target click area size.
Implement additional visual feedbacks (e.g., animations, color changes) upon user interactions.
